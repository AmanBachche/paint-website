#paint-website
This is a simple and responsive paint website that I built using HTML, CSS, and PHP.
It includes product listings, pricing details, and a clean user-friendly design that makes browsing easy and smooth.

ðŸ‘‰ All the files are written in PHP, but you can easily convert them into HTML if youâ€™d like ðŸ™‚.
ðŸ‘‰ For local hosting and testing, Iâ€™ve used XAMPP.

The goal of this project was to practice web development while creating something practical â€” a small online store-style website where paints (or any products) can be displayed neatly.
ðŸ’¡ Feel free to clone, explore, and customize it to make it your own!
